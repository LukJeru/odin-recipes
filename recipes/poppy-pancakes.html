    <h2>Tasty Pancakes with a zesty touch</h2>
    <p>
      I used to make those pancakes when I was living in my old flat in Berlin.<br>
      They're a bit more sophisticated than the plain ones and taste really great<br>
      with cream cheese.
    </p>
    <p>It's a really simple recipe and you don't need much to get a really tasty<br>
      breakfast out of it.
