  <h2>Flavourfull Vegetarian Tajine</h2>
  <p>Tajines are simply delicious but in the most cases they're made with meat.<br>
    Well, this one isn't and is just as falvourfull as the others.
  </p>
  <p>Unfortunately you need a tajine to make a tajine. And to heat up your tajine<br>
    you will also need a gas stove. I guess there are also other options but this is<br>
    the way I prepared my Tajine in Morocco.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Oil</li>
    <li>Onions</li>
    <li>Ras el-hanout</li>
    <li>Potatoes</li>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Carrots</li>
    <li>Herbs</li>
    <li>Zucchini</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>First dice the onion and slice the vegetables.</li>
    <li>Add some oil to the bottom of the tajine but dn't cook it yet.</li>
    <li>Then you can add the dices tomatoes and the Ras el-hanout.</li>
    <li>Now you have to build a kind of tent with the vegetables over the tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Drizzle with oil.</li>
    <li>Bring your tajine to a heat.</li>
    <li>Now you simply have to wait while the tajine is cooking.</li>
    <li>After around one hour you can add the herbs.</li>
  </ol>
